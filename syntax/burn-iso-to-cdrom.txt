Burn iso to cdrom


In windows 10 you can simply right click an iso and select to burn it to a disk.
1. Insert a blank CD or DVD in your writable optical drive.
2. Right-click on the ISO file and select "Burn disk image."
3. Select "Verify disc after burning" to make sure the ISO was burned without any errors.
4. Click Burn.
