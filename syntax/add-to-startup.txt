How to Run Program Automatically at Startup on Windows 10:

o First of all you need to locate your Startup.  But before that
  make a small note that each user on a computer has totally
  another Startup folder. So if you add a shortcut to any program
  to the Startup folder from the user account that you are logged
  into then it will run when that particular account is logged
  into. 

o So bring the Run command dialog box into your computer screen
  by pressing Windows and R

  Windows + R worked to bring up Run on SOA DNR BPU windows 10
  workstation.

o Type shell:startup on the command field and click Ok.

  Search for shell:startup yields:
    Marcil, Ray (OIT) > AppData > Roaming > Microsoft > Windows \
    Start Menu > Programs > Startup

  Search for and copied Skype for Business shortcut to
  Startup

o The Startup folder for the logged in user account will come on
  the screen.

o For the programs that you wish to run automatically at boot
  add their shortcuts to the Startup

o To create a program shortcut right click on an empty area of
  the Startup  folder and select New followed by Shortcut.

o  On the newly opened Create Shortcut window click on the
   Browse link and find the file that you wish to run
   automatically.

o Provide a name to the shortcut created.

o And click Finish.

o For the programs whose shortcuts are already created, you
  can shift them to the Startup

o In case you want to disable the created shortcuts than you
  can do from Task Manager.

o Or you can easily remove the shortcut from the Startup.
