Screenshots in Windows 10


To Take a Screenshot Without Saving
===================================
Press the “PrtScn” key.  A screenshot of your display is now copied to
the clipboard.  Open your favorite image editor, word processor, or
other program you want to use the image in.  Choose Edit > Paste to paste
the screenshot wherever you like.  The dimensions of the image will be
the same as your desktop resolution. Note: On some laptops and other
devices, you may need to press the “Alt + Fn + PrtScn” keys instead.
Check your laptop’s manual for more information.


To Take a Screenshot of Only One Window
=======================================
Click on the title bar of the window that you want to capture.
Press “Alt + PrtScn”.  A screenshot of your currently active window will
be copied to the clipboard, just as in the last section.  Paste it into
your favorite image editor or document editor.  Note: On some laptops and
other devices, you may need to press the “Alt + Fn + PrtScn” keys instead.
Check your laptop’s manual for more information.
