Screenshots in Windows 10

PrtScn key or windows logo key + PrtScn captures middle window
  of 3-display windows 10 workstation to buffer that can be
  pasted into gimp in windows 10 or gimp in virtualbox linux vm.
  Very nice.

Alt + PrtScn key - captures current window
  Very nice.

windows logo key + shift + S can be used to capture desired
  section of screen using a selection box.  Then ctrl-v into
  gimp.  No need to cut-paste-crop-save. 
  Very, very nice.

Snipping Tool - 'In Windows 10, Snipping Tool has a new “Delay”
  option, which will allow you to capture screenshots pop-up menus
  and tooltips. Open the Snipping Tool app and click Delay.  From
  the drop-down list, click on the number of seconds you’d like to
  wait until your screenshot is taken.

  Now choose the type of snip you want to make by clicking the arrow
  next to “New.”  You can choose from one of four types of snip:
  free-form, rectangular, window, and full-screen.

  Unlike a regular snip, the screen will not immediately fade out.
  Instead, you will have between 1–5 seconds, depending on the delay
  you chose, to set up your screenshots.  You can use this time to
  open that pop-up menu or tooltip you want to capture.  Once your
  seconds have passed, the screen will freeze and fade out so you
  can create your snip.  If you chose window or full-screen, it will
  just capture the snip immediately.'

To Take a Screenshot Without Saving
===================================
Press the “PrtScn” key.  A screenshot of your display is now copied to
the clipboard.  Open your favorite image editor, word processor, or
other program you want to use the image in.  Choose Edit > Paste to paste
the screenshot wherever you like.  The dimensions of the image will be
the same as your desktop resolution. Note: On some laptops and other
devices, you may need to press the “Alt + Fn + PrtScn” keys instead.
Check your laptop’s manual for more information.


To Take a Screenshot of Only One Window
=======================================
Click on the title bar of the window that you want to capture.
Press “Alt + PrtScn”.  A screenshot of your currently active window will
be copied to the clipboard, just as in the last section.  Paste it into
your favorite image editor or document editor.  Note: On some laptops and
other devices, you may need to press the “Alt + Fn + PrtScn” keys instead.
Check your laptop’s manual for more information.
