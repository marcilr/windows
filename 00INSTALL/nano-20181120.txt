Installation of GNU nano 
on Windows 10 OS Build 10586.1540 64-bit

Copy of git/gnu/nano/00INSTALL/INSTALL.txt (Wed November 21, 2018)

Downloaded nano-2.2.5.msi (1.99MB), set TERM to a value that works
for nano and vim in Windows, from:
  mcandre/nano-win
  https://github.com/mcandre/nano-win

Did not want to install Chocolatey on Windows 10 workstation.

Installed nano-2.2.5.msi (1.99MB) insalled to:
  C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\nano\bin\nano.exe

Nano was was not added to PATH by default, hence:
1. Update PATH:
click Windows icon
search for System
select System

2. At Control Panel Home
click Advanced systems settings

3. At System Properties
click Environment Variables

4. At Enviroment Variables under User variables:
click PATH
click Edit...

5. At Edit environment varaible
click Edit text...

6. At Edit User Variable
click Variable value box
Observed that C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\nano\bin\ had been appended
to PATH string.  Looks good.
click OK
click OK
click OK

NOTE: Found that running 'nano' at the dos prompt
      indeed runs GNU nano v2.2.5
